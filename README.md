## Analysis of school admission and performance data for Surrey and Hampshire

This repo contains data and analysis relating to primary school admission and performance data in Surrey and Hampshire for academic years beginning September 2016.

### Directory data-in
Contains the raw data used for the analysis. Note that due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, the UK Government is not publishing any data relating to school performance for 2020 and it is unlikely to do so for 2021. At the time of writing, this means that the most recent academic year for which performance data is available is 2018-2019.
